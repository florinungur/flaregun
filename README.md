# About the website

Flaregun has a perfect score on [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse).

The email check API [is now non-free](https://web.archive.org/web/20200708021002/https://www.troyhunt.com/authentication-and-the-have-i-been-pwned-api/),
so https://florinungur.github.io/flaregun/email-check is and will remain broken.
