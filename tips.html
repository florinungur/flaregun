        <h3>Use a password manager</h3>
        <h4><em>(Or, if you have few passwords, memorize them)</em></h4>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.slant.co" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Slant</a> has a nice list of password
          managers. Personally, I use Firefox's built-in solution because I don't like my passwords to be hosted on

          I also keep a few key passwords (like my disk encryption key) on paper, so that I won't be locked out of my
          laptop if I forget it.

        <h3>Lock all your screens</h3>
        <p>Why? So that people with physical access to your device cannot easily see its contents.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Find your devices</h3>
        <p>
          If your smartphone, tablet, or laptop has a 'Find my Device' feature, consider activating it so that you can
          locate the device or remotely wipe its contents should it be lost, stolen, or confiscated.

        <h3>Update everything</h3>
        <h4><em>(Even your router's firmware)</em></h4>
        <p>
          Most of the stuff one uses on a daily basis will have a mechanism to annoy you if it's out of date (browser,
          file editor, etc.) or will update without your consent (Windows, Android, etc.). However, your router's
          firmware can stay out of date for years without complaining. Same with your BIOS' firmware (if you're not
          using Apple). Give them some love; they support everything you do.

        <h3>Email is Satan's playground</h3>
        <p>
          The dance with the Devil will last you forever. However, if you have sold your soul already and have to use it
          (like me), do so without clicking on links, downloading attachments, the basics.

          There are technical ways to check if something fishy is happening with your computer: basically, log checking.
          If you don't have time for that, the easiest thing to do is check if your computer has been successfully
          exploited by using Troy Hunt's <em>beautiful</em> service (some bias present). If you have some more time, go
          to the dark web and look around for your identity.
